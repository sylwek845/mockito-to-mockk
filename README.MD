TODO

1. Implement argumentCaptor to slot
2. Add more tests coverages
3. Add main function which takes path param to file
4. **Optional** Convert into gradle plugin?-> Release?
5. Update Readme

Known Issues

1. Parser may fail if function or param name contains escape chars
2. Unnecessary spaces may break the parser - format the code before running it
